## Overview

From 2019–2022, QuantumWire generated $28M in total sales across 108K orders, with an average order value (AOV) of $260. Sales revenue rose steadily through 2019 before spiking sharply in 2020, peaking at $3M in Q4.

The 2020 surge coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumer demand shifted heavily toward online electronics purchases. However, as conditions normalized, sales began to decline—dropping by roughly 10% in 2021 and a further 46% in 2022 resulting in a return to a more typical pre-2020 baseline.

Overall focus would need to be stabilizing post-pandemic performance by analyzing customer retention and product mix to identify repeat purchase opportunities. Consider reinforcing marketing and loyalty initiatives that proved successful during the 2020 growth period to re-engage high-value segments.
