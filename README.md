## Overview

<img width="3875" height="2319" alt="Sales By Quarter" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/920841d2-d0c7-4053-9534-681b166ade27" />

<p></p>

* From 2019–2022, QuantumWire generated $28M in total sales across 108K orders, with an average order value (AOV) of $260. Sales grew steadily through 2019 before surging in 2020 and peaking at $3M in Q4, marking the company’s highest-performing quarter on record.

* The 2020 spike aligned with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumer demand shifted heavily toward online electronics purchases. As market conditions normalized, sales declined—falling roughly 10% in 2021 and 46% in 2022—returning to a more typical pre-pandemic baseline.

* The 2020 performance serves as a benchmark for QuantumWire’s strongest growth opportunity. The surge was likely driven by high-demand product categories and accelerated online adoption. Analyzing the specific products, campaigns, and customer behaviors that fueled this period could help identify strategies to reignite an uptrend in Sales Revenue

## Sales Revenue By Product

<img width="3914" height="2090" alt="Sales By Quarter By Product 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef98c90e-33e8-47a0-bdf4-198de13c6709" />

* Diving deeper into product performance, three items—the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor, Apple AirPods, and MacBook Air—accounted for nearly 85% of total revenue. This heavy concentration suggests that QuantumWire’s growth is strongly tied to a few top-performing products. Exploring ways to expand or upsell within these categories, such as bundling accessories or offering premium variations, could further increase revenue and strengthen customer loyalty.

* Conversely, reviewing the lower-performing products may reveal opportunities to phase out or replace underperforming products. Streamlining the product portfolio and reallocating marketing resources toward high-demand items could improve overall profitability and sales efficiency.

## Growth Rates

<img width="3703" height="2151" alt="Top 3 Products Growth Rate Line Graph" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da105b7-83b2-48b8-bcd5-20173e10c70a" />

<p></p>

* A closer look at QuantumWire’s top three products — the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor, Apple AirPods Headphones, and MacBook Air Laptop — highlights the growth during the 2020 surge and decline thereafter. The Gaming Monitor remained the most stable performer, contributing over 30% of revenue each year, while the MacBook Air drove the largest single-year growth during the 2020 surge.

* MacBook Air sales grew more than 380% from 2019 to 2020, making it the company’s fastest-growing product. However, it also had the greatest decline among the 3 products, with sales declining -35% in 2021 and then a further -55% decline in 2022 as post-pandemic demand normalized. Renewed focus on targeted marketing, refreshed product bundles, or complementary upsells such as accessories and protection plans—could help revive interest and lift overall revenue for the Macbook Air

## Loyalty Program Trends

<p></p>

*Since launching the Loyalty Program in 2019, the share of loyalty member revenue has been shown consistent growth upwards and eventually overtaking Non-loyalty in Q2 2021 and stabilizing at 50-60% of sale revenue. This sustained performance suggests that the program has been successful in converting customers into repeat purchasers.

*Looking at Total Revenue tells a slightly different story where since the start of the loyalty program, non-loyalty members have generated 17M in total where as Loyalty members contributed 10M. However, from 2021–2022, Loyalty members surpassed Non-Loyalty members in both revenue and sales volume, signaling growing engagement within the program.

* Since launching the Loyalty Program in 2019, Non-Loyalty members have generated $17M in total revenue, compared to $10M from Loyalty members. However, from 2021–2022, Loyalty members surpassed Non-Loyalty members in both revenue and sales volume, signaling growing engagement within the program.

* In 2021, Loyalty members led with 19,552 sales versus 16,306 for Non-Loyalty members, but their average order value (AOV) lagged slightly at $249 compared to $261. By 2022, this trend reversed—Loyalty members achieved a higher AOV ($245 vs. $214), further underscoring their increased long-term value.

* Over time, Loyalty Member sales revenue has shown consistent growth, overtaking Non-Loyalty revenue in Q2 2021 and stabilizing at 50–60% of total sales revenue. This sustained performance suggests that the program has successfully converted customers into repeat purchasers.

* The Loyalty Program should continue as a core driver of customer retention. Although Loyalty Member Revenue Growth has been flat from late 2021 through early 2022, the long-term trend remains positive. Ongoing monitoring of Revenue Trends and Purchase Frequency will help determine how to further strengthen the program’s impact.

## Refund Rates

<img width="2240" height="1458" alt="Refund Rates By Product 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afc265c9-83b6-44ce-a36d-4d01aa57d3aa" />

<p></p>

* Refund Data from 2019–2022 shows that two products—the Apple AirPods and the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor—account for roughly 75% of all refunds. This concentration suggests that while these products are top sellers, they also represent the largest share of return-related volume.

<img width="1597" height="423" alt="Total Refund Rates 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525370a7-52cf-4b7e-af63-65b223ac9524" />

* However, looking beyond total return counts, the refund rate (the percentage of each product sold that was refunded) reveals a different risk profile. The ThinkPad Laptop (11.7%) and MacBook Air Laptop (11.4%) have the highest refund rates, despite representing a smaller share of total sales. Both products also carry high average order values (AOVs)—$1,100 and $1,588 respectively—meaning each return has an outsized impact on revenue.

These findings indicate two areas of opportunity for Refunds:

Look into reducing return volume for the AirPods and Gaming Monitor through better product quality checks, packaging, or customer education.

Investigate refund drivers for the ThinkPad and MacBook Air, where even a small reduction in refund rate could significantly protect revenue given their high AOVs.

Addressing these issues collectively could not only lower overall refund but also improve customer satisfaction and margin stability across QuantumWire’s core product lines.


## Apple Product Refund Rates
  
<img width="2609" height="1844" alt="Apple Products Refund Rates" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce64900-566d-4464-af04-218df7e157d2" />

<p></p>

* Within QuantumWire’s Apple product line, MacBook Air Laptops and AirPods Headphones account for 99% of all refunds, making them the key contributors to Apple-related return volume. This is largely consistent across the 2019–2022 period, highlighting a structural trend in customer behavior rather than a short-term fluctuation.

* While the iPhone represents only a small share of total refunds, it ranks among the top three products in refund rate across all categories. With an average order value (AOV) of $741, even a minor increase in its refund rate could have a disproportionate effect on revenue compared to lower-priced products such as AirPods. Monitoring iPhone return trends and identifying early refund triggers could prevent high-value revenue loss while maintaining customer satisfaction.

* Overall, reducing refund volume for AirPods and MacBooks would improve operational efficiency, while proactively managing refund risk for high-AOV products like the iPhone would safeguard profitability.

## Recommendations

### Sales
* Analyze specific products, campaigns and customer behaviors that could reignite growth in Sales Revenue.
* Look deeper into the Top 3 Products and come up with strategies to expand or upsell through these products to increase revenue and streamline product portfolio
* Given the significant decline in sales by the Macbook Air, a look into ways to improve marketing, upsell or cross selling could be implemented to reverse sales trend.

### Loyalty Program
* With the positive trend in Loyalty Member revenue, order count and AOV, finding way to further enhance member benefits through exclusive rewards, discounts and promotions could increase its appeal

### Refunds
* Look into the high refund rate for the Thinkpad and Macbook Air and tweak any operational quirks that could be driving this high rate such as service or packaging.
* Look into reducing return volume for Airpods and Gaming Monitor as they account for a significant number of refunds. Resolving this can improve operational efficiency and increase customer satisfaction.
